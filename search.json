We fit a logistic regression model including treatment type, voter engagement, sex, and age. Results show that certain postcards, especially the ‘Neighbors’ and ‘Self’ treatments, increase turnout more among infrequent voters. While the model provides useful estimates, uncertainty and assumptions mean results should be interpreted cautiously."
